# FrePIE

A basic implementation of ePIE for soft x-ray ptychography using C linked to Python. Done for the purpose of learning how to write and call more performant code within Python when needed. Originally, I planned on implementing the backend with Fortran, hence "FrePIE", but I gave up using that arcane language and kept the name.
